# Randomized-QB-MATLAB
In this work, you may observe a reference implementation of several fixed-precision randomized QB factorization algorithms for matrices of real values.

This repository contains:
  1.Six randomized QB routines of different properties, detailed description of each is available inside of functions + Generalized Nystrom algorithm routine for low-rank matrix approximation.
  2.Gaussian random matrix generator & Rademacher random matrix generator.
  3.Small image processing routine.
  4.Main file that is being used as a testing ground.
  5.Three test files that plot results of rand QB routines executions in terms of accuracy.
  6.Test file for timing rand QB and Nystrom algorithms.
  7.Three test matrix generation routines.
  8.An image to be used for testing pusposes.
