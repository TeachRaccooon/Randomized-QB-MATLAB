# Randomized-QB-MATLAB
In this work, you may observe a reference implementation of several fixed-precision randomized QB factorization algorithms for matrices of real values.

This repository contains:
  1.Five randomized QB routines of different properties, detailed description of each is available inside of functions.
  2.Random Gaussian matrix generator & Rademacher random matrix generator.
  3.Small image processing routine.
  4.Main file that is being used as a testing ground.
  5.A set of images that were used for testing purposes.
